Traces Configuration
=====================

Airflow can be set up to send traces in `OpenTelemetry <https://opentelemetry.io>`__.

Setup - OpenTelemetry
---------------------

To use OpenTelemetry you must first install the required packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install 'apache-airflow[otel]'

Add the following lines to your configuration file e.g. ``airflow.cfg``

.. code-block:: ini

    [traces]
    otel_on = True
    otel_task_log_event = True

Configure the SDK, by exporting the regular OTel variables to your environment

.. code-block:: ini

    - export protocol
      |_ values: 'grpc', 'http/protobuf'
      |_ default: 'grpc'
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL

    - endpoint
      |_ example for grpc protocol: 'http://localhost:4317'
      |_ example for http protocol: 'http://localhost:4318/v1/traces'
      |_ if SSL is enabled, use 'https' instead of 'http'
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
      or
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT

    - service name
      |_ default: 'Airflow'
    OTEL_SERVICE_NAME

    - resource attributes
      |_ values: 'key1=value1,key2=value2,...'
      |_ example: 'service.name=my-service,service.version=1.0.0'
    OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES

    - list of headers to apply to all outgoing traces
      |_ values: 'key1=value1,key2=value2,...'
      |_ example: 'api-key=key,other-config-value=value'
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS

Enable Https
-----------------

To establish an HTTPS connection to the OpenTelemetry collector
You need to configure the SSL certificate and key within the OpenTelemetry collector's ``config.yml`` file.

.. code-block:: yaml

   receivers:
     otlp:
       protocols:
         http:
           endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
           tls:
             cert_file: "/path/to/cert/cert.crt"
             key_file: "/path/to/key/key.pem"
